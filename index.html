                        Thank you for visiting my webpage. My name is Sataporn. I am an applied research scientist working on machine learning and software prototyping. I am incredibly interested in applying the latest research to real-world problems and creating proof of concept for business applications. I'm experienced in big data, synthetic images, and word embeddings. I love working on new projects and exploring the power of machine learning.

                        In my previous position at Likewise and US Bank, I worked as a quality engineer with a focus on test automation. I learned a lot from that position, but my passion is in building new things that impacts people, rather than solely testing them. Please see my <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sataporn-w-66268177" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile for a detailed career timeline.

                        I grew up in Atlanta, GA. I attended Georgia Institute of Technology for my undergraduate degree from 2011 to 2018. During that time I explored various industries and studies. Toward the end of my time at Tech, I reflected on my journey and what I enjoyed the most. One thing became apparent, CS-2316 was my favorite class. The crux of that was to build an AOL-style chat program. For the longest time, I thought that computers and software were so complex that I wouldn't be able to understand how it all works, but this project reveals “how the sausage gets made”, and I want to go make more sausages! With the blessing from my parents, I stayed for another 2 years at Georgia Tech to add a computer science degree.

                        Upon graduation, I took a job at Elavon (U.S. Bank) as a Jr. Quality Engineer. I loved my time there. I got to work on a brand-new product line, sadly the project got shelved after I left. In the short time that I was there, I worked with incredibly smart and talented people, I got to spend a few weeks during the holiday season building a prototype extension to the main product. Since Elavon's focus is on merchant payment processing, the prototype aims to add value by including a table and waitlist management system to help capture customers and increase throughput. I worked on the backend API portion of the project, which was a nice change to the everyday task.

                        After a year at Elavon, I relocated to Seattle to pursue a love interest at the time and to join an early-stage start-up, Likewise. Likewise is a recommendation platform for digital entertainment. Likewise is building an incredibly interesting data set for the entertainment industry. I was the second QA at the company, I focused on the web app experience and data integrity. I developed web UI automation tests with Cypress and wrote Python scripts to validate data from 3rd party sources. Web automation reduced web release time by almost 50%. My Python script found that about 10% of links from the 3rd party data providers were incorrect.
