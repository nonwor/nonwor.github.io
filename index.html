            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my webpage. I am an aspiring software engineer. 
                I am currently enrolled at Per Scholas, a boot camp-style training program aim to retool professionals and helping with career transition. 
                In my previous position at Likewise Inc and US Bank, I worked as a quality analyst with a focus on test automation. 
                I learned a lot from that position, but my passion is in building tools, rather than solely testing them. 
                Please see my <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sataporn-w-66268177">LinkedIn</a> profile for a detailed career timeline.
